    "The Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS) was a major astronomical survey, that took almost 2,000 photographic plates of the night sky that was completed by the end of 1958. The photographs were taken with the 48-inch Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory.\n",

    "The survey utilized 14-inch square photographic plates, covering about 6° of sky per side. Each region of the sky was photographed twice, once using a red plate, and once with a blue sensitive plate.\n",

    "POSS was mostly completed just proir to the launch of Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957, meaning the original POSS prints have NO satellite trails on them.\n",
